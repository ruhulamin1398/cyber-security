# 8 best practices

1. **Back up your files:** The most effective way to handle ransomware attacks is to use the 3-2-1 backup rule: keep at least three separate versions of data on two different storage types with atleast one offsite.
2. **Educate end users:** Regularly train your employees on how to identify and avoid common ransomware pitfalls such as malvertisements, phishing emails, etc.
3. **Patch vulnerabilities:** Reduce the vulnerabilities in your operating systems, browsers, and other applications by regularly updating them.
4. **Use an intrusion detection system:** Cut off ransomware attacks in their early stages using continuous monitoring to detect signs of anomalous or malicious activity in real time.
5. **Employ email filtering:** Block malicious executables, spam, phishing emails, and other methods ransomware is known to use.
6. **Whitelist applications** Add acceptable software to your whitelist and block unauthorized programs from running.
7. **Provide the least amount of privilege possible** Use robust access management to restrict unwarranted access and reduce the number of access points through which malware can enter your organization.
8. **Logically separate networks** Mitigate data loss in the event of a ransomware attack by separating your networks according to task or department
